# Roadmap

Planned features and improvements for afk. Feedback and suggestions welcome.

## Planned

### Improved Status Page

Enhance `afk status` with richer information display including a full task list, progress visualisation, and session statistics. Currently status shows basic session info; the goal is to make it a comprehensive dashboard for understanding project state at a glance.

### Ollama Support

Add Ollama as a supported AI CLI backend, enabling fully local AI coding loops without requiring cloud API keys. This would allow developers to run autonomous coding sessions using local models on their own hardware.

### AI Token Usage Metrics

Track and report token consumption across iterations and sessions. Display cumulative usage, per-task costs, and provide insights into which tasks consume the most tokens. Useful for cost management and understanding AI efficiency.

### Estimated Completion

Provide time and iteration estimates for completing remaining tasks based on historical performance data. Use metrics from past sessions to predict when the current task list might be finished, helping with planning and expectations.
