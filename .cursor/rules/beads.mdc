# Overview

This project uses `bd` (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started. Always use `beads create` to track tasks.

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
bd help               # Help with BD  
```
