# Colour Palette Generator

A tool for generating harmonious colour palettes for design work.

## Overview

- Spacebar generates a new random palette
- Clicking a swatch locks/unlocks it (locked colours persist through regeneration)
- Each swatch shows its hex code
- Clicking hex code copies it to clipboard
- Export button downloads palette as JSON or CSS variables
- Palette state persists in URL hash for sharing
