# Markdown Previewer

A live markdown editor with instant preview.

## Overview

Build a split-pane markdown editor using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The left pane accepts markdown input, the right pane renders the HTML output in real-time. No external markdown libraries — implement basic parsing from scratch.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Split view with resizable panes
- Left pane is a textarea for markdown input
- Right pane renders parsed HTML live as user types
- Support headings, bold, italic, links, code blocks, and lists
- Sample markdown loads on first visit
- Content persists in localStorage
- Clean typography in the preview pane
