# Pomodoro Timer

A minimal, elegant Pomodoro timer web application.

## Overview

Build a single-page Pomodoro timer using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or build tools — just clean, working code. The app helps users focus using the Pomodoro technique: 25-minute work sessions with 5-minute breaks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Timer displays minutes and seconds in large, readable format
- Start button begins countdown, converts to Pause while running
- Reset button stops timer and restores to initial duration
- Visual distinction between work mode (warm colours) and break mode (cool colours)
- Audio plays when timer reaches zero
- Automatically suggests switching mode when timer completes
- Session count persists across browser sessions
- Works in modern browsers without external dependencies
